# Academic Journal

Academic Journal is a small journal application meant for researchers where they can take notes on their progress daily.

The aim is to eventually have good Bibtex integration and other nice features, making it easier to write scientific
publications when the time comes.

#### Note

I am aware that there are several note taking applications, this is mainly just for fun, and likely won't replace any of
the higher end note-taking apps.
However, I can customize this to my personal needs, and hobby projects are just so much more fun.
