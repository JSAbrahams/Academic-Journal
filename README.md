# üìö Academic Journal

Academic Journal is a small journal application meant for researchers where they can take notes on their progress daily.

This is meant to be more akin to a note-taking application with good citation integration, as opposed to most reference
managers, where the focus is much more on the literature itself and less so on the personal notes of the user.
Here, the focus is now on the user's notes, as the user can freely describe what they did each day, and refer to
literature if they so choose.

The aim is to eventually have good Bibtex integration and quality of life features.
Additionally, it should be possible to export to other reference formats if the demand is there.
Ideally, being able to quickly go through one's notes and see what has been cited when and why should make it easier to
write a publication as opposed to having to sift through papers to find off-hand notes (possibly without any context aside
from the literature it is citing).
It would be interesting to also introduce creative visualization of notes, keywords, and citations.
How useful this all will be remains to be seen.

#### üìù Note

I am aware that there are several note taking applications, this is mainly just for fun.
It likely won't replace any of the higher end note-taking apps, and I don't see it replacing some of the better reference
managers anytime soon (these often have features which I consider to be currently out of scope).
However, I can customize this to my personal needs, and hobby projects are just so much more fun anyway.
